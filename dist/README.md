####Distribution Files


The distribution folder holds the source and compressed versions of the paging directive.

The distribution files are built using [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) when a tagged version is released - see the `src` folder for latest

Any [bower](https://bower.io/) references should use either the source or compressed version.

Any Content Delivery Networks would reference these files.
